# Web App Architecture

## Introduction

How do web clients and web servers talk to one another?

Our goal is to build a web application that clients around the globe can access.

## Client/Server

### Web Server

Takes a client request and gives something back to the client.

### Client

Lets the user request something on the server, and shows the user the result of the request.
